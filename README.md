A simple webpage for consuming my API and rendering data in HTML. I didn't use any front-end framework, and the styling is very basic. My focus is on the back-end. 
This project serves the sole purpose of demonstrating how my API works. 
It includes features such as delete, put, add, and get by ID methods to manipulate a PostgreSQL database named 'foods'. 
The back-end was built with Java + Spring Boot and includes several dependencies, such as Spring Data JPA, Spring Web, Spring DevTools, PostgreSQL driver, among others. 
The repository for this project is already on my GitHub under the repository 'LpFoods-backend'. I plan to add documentation to explain my development decisions. 
Thank you for your attention, and I hope my code is useful to you.
